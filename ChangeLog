2011-15-04 v1.4.0
        * Convert project to autotools (Ã  la LinBox et Givaro)
2008-06-05 v1.3.3
	* fix the design of specializations to modular<double> modular<float>
	* give a proper name to ModularBalanced
	* fix the bugs in the bound computations (Winograd recursion over the
	finite field was too deep)
	* prepare the interface for integrating compressed representation for
	small finite fields
2007-09-28 v1.3.2
	* add routines fgetrs and fgesv (cf LAPACK), for system solving.
	  supports rectangular, over/underdetermined systems.
2007-08-29 v1.3.1
	* add the benchmark directory, for automatic benchmarking against GOTO
	and ATLAS BLAS. Adapted from Pascal Giorgi's benchmark system.
2007-08-28 v1.3.0
	* new version of ftrmm ftrsm: ftrsm based on a multicascade algorithm
	reducing the number of modular reductions). Automated generation of each
	of the 48 specializations 
	* several bug fixes
	* add regression tests: testeur_fgemm, testeur_lqup and testeur_ftrsm
2007-07-05 v1.2.2
	* add a transposed version of the LQUP decomposition routine
	LUdivine
	* fix many bugs in LUdivine
	* new schedules for Winograd algorithm for matrix multiplication:
	2 cases depending whether beta = 0 or not, taken form [Huss
	Ledermann & Al. 96]
	* add rowEchelon and ReducedRowEchelon routines + associated tests
2007-06-21 v1.2.1
	* add the use of float BLAS, if the field caradinality is small enough
	* improve genericity: gemm can be use over any field domain (not
	requiring any conversion to a integral representation)
	* add a variant of Winograd's algorithm with less temporaries for
	the operation C = AxB
	* add ColumnEchelon and ReducedColumnEchelon routines, using an
	inplace algorithm, based on the LQUP decompositon of LUdivine
	* add routines ftrtri (replacing invL), ftrtrm.
	* fix bunch of memory leaks in the tests (not yet finished)
2007-03-13 v1.1.2
	* change the genericity system for trsm to detect Field
	implementations over double (compatibility with LinBox)
2007-03-11 v1.1.1
	* complete preconditioning phase for the new Charpoly algorithm
	* new Charpoly algorithm renamed CharpolyArithProg
	* add exception for failure of the LasVegas algrithm
	* default charpoly is now: 2 attempts to CharpolyArithProg, then LUKrylov

2007-02-27 v1.1.0
	* change some naming conventions in the directories
	* add a LQUP routine for small dimension (LUdivine_small) and the
	cascading with LUdivine
	* put the bound computations in the same file
	* add dense_generator.C for the generation of random dense
	matrices in tests
	* add the new algorithm for characteristic polynomial (temporarily
	named frobenius)
	
2006-08-11 v1.0.1
	* add the field implementation modular-positive.h, especially for
	p=2
	* add a the flag 'balanced' to the finite fields modular<double>,
	to switch to the apropriate bound computation (fgemm and trsm)
	* fix a bug in LUDivine LQUP elimination (initialisation of the
	permutation P for N=1 in the terminal case)
	* fix a bug in the determination of the number of recursive levels
	of Winograd Algorithm.
